# House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

This project aims to predict house prices based on their square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms using a linear regression model. It provides a practical application of linear regression in the real estate domain, helping to estimate house prices based on key features.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that estimates house prices given the following features:
- **Square Footage**: The total area of the house in square feet.
- **Number of Bedrooms**: The total number of bedrooms in the house.
- **Number of Bathrooms**: The total number of bathrooms in the house.

### Key Features

- **Dataset**: Contains information about house features and corresponding prices.
- **Model**: Linear regression is used to model the relationship between features and house prices.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: The model is evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (RÂ²) score.
